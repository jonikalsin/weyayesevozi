The dating show returned after it stopped airing for nearly four years. So, does he find a partner there? While the show answers the question, we are here to introduce you to his family, age, job, and other details.</p><p>Hence, join us to learn more about the handsome hunk through this short bio.</p><h3><strong>Aqel Carson On Are You The One?</strong></h3><p>Aquel Carson is one of the 22 cast members of Are You The One? In the intro video, he described himself in three words: “pretty, f—-, Awesome”. He stated that “his height is his best feature and his lips because he can kiss well.” And, his hair.</p><p>After four years of hiatus, Are You The One? is back on Paramount+ for season 9 with brand new casts of 22 singletons from around the world.</p><p>The first international dating program, AYTO, debuted on MTV in 2014 and featured singles from all over the world, placing them in exotic locations for romantic getaways. (Previous seasons were filmed in New Orleans, Louisiana, Hawaii, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.) Prior to filming, each participant in the show must pass lengthy interviews and compatibility testing. The program then employs a unique matchmaking algorithm tool to guarantee that every contestant (at least 20) has a “perfect match.”</p><p>Throughout the course of the season, competitors must determine their true love using a “truth booth” that will either affirm or refute a couple’s compatibility. The group of competitors wins a $1,000,00 prize if they correctly identify every real match in 10 or fewer “match-up ceremonies” or attempts. The prizes are, however, divided in half each time the candidates at these ceremonies are unable to identify any new matches.</p><p>In addition, it should be mentioned that the show had heterosexual pairings in its earlier seasons, switched to a completely bisexual cast in its eighth season, and featured competitors who identified as both genders, allowing any two couples to be their matches.</p><p>The new season of AYTO’s first two episodes premieres on January 18, 2023. Gran Canaria, one of Spain’s Canary Islands, serves as the setting for this year’s show, which is hosted by Kamie Crawford.</p><p>Before the show’s premiere, Aqel announced, “ITS TIME!!🎉 So glad that I’m finally able to share with y’all!😁 Tune in on January 18th streaming exclusively on&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#paramountplus</a>&nbsp;and catch me on the wildest season of&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#ayto</a> yet!😜🥳 I promise y’all won’t be disappointed.”</p><h3><strong>What Is Aqel Carson Relationship Status?</strong></h3><p>Though Aqel Carson’s Facebook reveals that he is “single”, it seems he hasn’t been on Facebook for a long time.
