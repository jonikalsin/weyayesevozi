Who was Renee Portnoy married to?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Renee Portnoy (née Satherwaite) is an American equestrian professional and social media influencer. She is best known as the ex-wife of Barstool Sports founder, Dave Portnoy.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Portnoy was born in Abington, Massachusetts, on May 5th, 1983.</p><p>Her father, Dennis Satterthwaite, was an officer in the US Armed Forces, while her mother, Sheryl Satterthwaite, was a nurse.</p><p>Her parents divorced when she was six years old.</p><p>Renee also has a sister, Lauren Satterthwaite.</p><p>Portnoy loved animals from a young age, and was particularly enamored of horses. This would later lead her to her chosen profession.</p><p>Portnoy went to high school in her hometown of Abington; she later attended Boston University, where she obtained a BS in international relations and business.</p><h2><strong>Professional Career</strong></h2><p><br>Renee joined the animal health services company SmartPak in 2012, where she worked as a senior buyer.</p><p>Portnoy was easily able to translate her love of horses and her previous experience into skills applicable to her new job, and she continues to work for the company to this day.</p><p>Renee joined SmartPak as a senior buyer, and was responsible for overseeing contracts and making purchase orders for the company.</p><p>After two years with the company, she became the Director of Merchandising – a title she still holds today.</p><h3><strong>Renee’s Rescues</strong></h3><p><br>Portnoy also runs a dog rescue shelter, Renee’s Rescues, in Nantucket, Boston. The shelter provides a safe place for unwanted puppies, and helps to rehome the puppies with caring new owners.</p><p>In addition, Renee is involved with the Nantucket Island Safe Harbor for Animals, which acts as a foster home for neglected or unwanted animals.</p><p>Portnoy frequently visits the shelter personally in order to take care of its wards.</p><p>Portnoy shares much of her work with the animals on social media, and as a result, has gained a considerable following. On Instagram, she has 37,500 followers, while her Twitter account is followed by more than 32,000 people.</p><h2><strong>Husband</strong></h2><p>Renee Portnoy met <a href=#>Dave Portnoy</a> in 2005 and quickly began dating.

Portnoy’s contribution to the blog was so significant that she earned the nickname “the First Lady of Barstool Sports.”</p><h2><strong>Divorce</strong></h2><p>Renee Portnoy and her husband were married for around 8 years before separating – and divorcing – in 2017. Their split was not an amicable one, with allegations of infidelity on Dave’s part soon surfacing. Portnoy herself did not publicly comment on the allegations.</p><h2><strong>Boyfriend</strong></h2><p>Renee Portnoy has been in a relationship with an unnamed man since 2021, though she has never released his name to the public or given any details about him beyond a few pictures that she posted to her Instagram account. The two frequently enjoy vacations to exotic destinations together.</p><p>Dave is currently dating Colombian fashion model, Silvana Mojica.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-63418 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dave-Portnoy-and-girlfriend-Silvana-Mojica.jpg.webp alt="Dave Portnoy and girlfriend Silvana Mojica" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dave-Portnoy-and-girlfriend-Silvana-Mojica.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-63418 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><h2><strong>Children</strong></h2><p>At the time of writing, Renee Portnoy has no children.</p><h2><strong>Renee Portnoy – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>So, how much is Renee Portnoy worth? Renee earned most of her wealth from working at SmartPak as well as from her involvement in Barstool Sports. Therefore, Renee Portnoy has an estimated net worth of $4 million.</p><p>On the other hand, Renee’s ex-husband has a net worth of $300 million. Dave Portnoy’s net worth rocketed after he sold Barstool Sports to Penn Entertainment for $550 million. In August 2023, Portnoy said he bought back Barstool Sports for a “nominal cash consideration ($1.00 dollar).”</p><p>The divorce settlement included the couple’s $2 million mansion in Nantucket. The couple bought the house in 2015, and it was valued at $2.2 million in 2020. It has five bedrooms and four bathrooms.</p><p>Note – Dave purchased a waterfront home in Morningside, Miami, for $14 million in 2021.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong></h2><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>What is Anna Cramling’s net worth</a>?</p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Dan Gronkowski Net Worth</a></p><p style=text-align:center><a href=#>Who is Denis Asamoah’s fiancée</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfp7KvscRmp6iqpKO8unnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5x66qm5memXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frenee-portnoy-net-worth-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frenee-portnoy-net-worth-husband.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frenee-portnoy-net-worth-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frenee-portnoy-net-worth-husband.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frenee-portnoy-net-worth-husband.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frenee-portnoy-net-worth-husband.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./smokie-norful-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./smokie-norful-net-worth.html>Smokie Norful Net Worth - Pulptastic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./renato-abreu.html>Renato Abreu</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./renato-abreu.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
