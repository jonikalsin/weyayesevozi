On August 29, 1931, Barry Collier was brought into the world by his parents, Helen Ettinger Collier and Samuel B. Collier. Collier was born in the city of Detroit, which is located in the state of Michigan. His mother and father were overjoyed to finally get their son. In the year 1956, Barry attended both the University of Michigan School of Dentistry and the University of Detroit in order to improve his education in the field of dentistry.</p><p>He did this as part of his initiative to further his education. During his time in the service, he served in a number of different areas across the world, including Savannah, Georgia, France, and Germany. He joined the United States Air Force in 1956 and participated in the military for a period of time. Those who are able to carry on his legacy include his wife Judy, his daughter Karen (Scott) Whetter, his granddaughters Ava and Gracie, his daughter Amy Collier, his son Steven (Jenny) Collier, his granddaughters Ashley, Lindsey, Paige, and Victoria, his sister Sandy Fox, his father-in-law Larry Gaige, and ten great-grandchildren.</p><p>His legacy will be carried on by these individuals. A number of people had previously passed away before to his passing, including his daughter Kerry Jean Boardman, her father, and his sister Linda Elias. He was the last of his family members to pass away. As a result of the fact that Barry and his family were able to enjoy a great deal of happiness and joy while they were in Duck Lake, he felt a great deal of pride for them. After becoming a skilled dentist for fifty years and devoting his entire life to his job, Barry made the decision to retire when he was eighty years old. He had dedicated his entire life to his profession.</p><p>In his practice, he displayed an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm. Albion, which is located in the state of Michigan in the United States of America, was the location of his first private practice, which he founded in August of 1961. The year 2011 was the year that he officially retired from Jackson, Michigan. As evidence of his significant involvement in the community, he had previously served as president of the Jackson District Dental Society, the Albion Lions Club, and the Albion Civic Theatre. This is evidence of his commitment to the community. He was very active in the community and served in many capacities.</p><p>As an additional point of interest, he served on the boards of directors for the United Way Fund, the Albion Zoning Board, the Albion Civic Foundation Board, and the Albion School Board. All of these organizations are located in Albion. Additionally, he was a member of each of these boards throughout his time there. He was a regular golfer and a member of the Duck Lake Country Club for a considerable amount of time. He also played golf on a regular basis outside of the club. As Barry progressed through his life, he developed a wide variety of interests, which included a wide range of activities and hobbies. His early years were spent driving Alfa Romeo automobiles and competing in races all across Europe. He was a member of the Alfa Romeo Racing Club.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwrsCrqbJlk6S5rbXEq2SompmpwqK%2B2GaaqKapmr%2B0ecaaZLCgkal6qa3PqZynnZRiwbB5wZqpq7FdmLytuMieqWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbarry-collier-obituary-conyers-ga-what-happened-to-barry-collier.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbarry-collier-obituary-conyers-ga-what-happened-to-barry-collier.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbarry-collier-obituary-conyers-ga-what-happened-to-barry-collier.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbarry-collier-obituary-conyers-ga-what-happened-to-barry-collier.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbarry-collier-obituary-conyers-ga-what-happened-to-barry-collier.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbarry-collier-obituary-conyers-ga-what-happened-to-barry-collier.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./nicholas-smith.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./nicholas-smith.html>Nicholas Smith Age | Wiki, Net worth, Bio, Height, Wife</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./joey-calcaterra-brother-frankie-nick-age-wikipedia.html>Who Are Joey Calcaterra Brother Frankie And Nick?
