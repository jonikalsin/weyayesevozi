<time>28 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Marilyn Manson has filed a lawsuit against his former fiancee, Rachel Woods and her friend artist Illma Gire for defamation in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday. Rachel had accused Manson of abusing her horrifically for years in 2020 and prior to that, she had given a testimony to a Congressional committee in 2018 saying she had been raped and abused.</span></p><p><span>Many women came forward with their allegations against Manson and he was dropped by his record label. There is also an upcoming HBO documentary that explains all the allegations premiering on 15 March.</span></p><p><span>Manson has <a href=# rel=noopener>filed against Rachel</a> claiming that her allegations were fabricated and she had been engaged in a conspiracy with Gore where they <strong>"recruited, coordinated and pressured prospective accusers to emerge simultaneously with allegations of rape and abuse against Warner and brazenly claim that it took ten or more years to realize their consensual relationships with Warner were supposedly abusive."</strong></span></p><p><span>The documents also said that they impersonated and forged a letter from a real FBI agent to create the false impression of being threatened by Manson. Moreover, those women also provided checklists and scripts to prospective accusers and described all the fake claims. Manson's email, phone and social media accounts were also hacked and a phony email was created for emailing illegal pornography and prank called authorities to draw further attention to those false allegations.</span></p><p><span>Marilyn's attorney Howard King also said that the detailed complaint was filed in order to stop a campaign of malicious and unjustified attacks on Brian Warner. Meanwhile, Rachel Wood and Illma Gore has yet to response to the lawsuit.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Marilyn Manson Was Engaged To Rachel Wood</span></strong></h2><p><span>Marilyn Manson first met Rachel Wood at a party at Los Angeles' famed Chateau Marmont in 2006 and made their relationship official. Manson was married too Von Teese in November 2005 but she filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split. They were diovrced in 2007.</span></p><p><span>Marilyn then proposed to Rachel on stage in Paris after dating on-off for three years. However, their engagement was called off after eight months and they moved on from their relationships. Later in 2015, Rachel had shared that they just weren't right for each other but she appreciated everything he taught her. She added that&nbsp; she felt really free with him.</span></p><p><span>Rachel spoke about her romance with Manson in an interview with Rolling Stone and shared that she met somebody who promised her dreedom and expression with no judgements. She also recalled how she got hurt when people called her a whore.</span></p><p><span>Rachel then talked about her abusive relationship from 2018 after the #MeToo movement and gave more detailed accusations against Manson via her insatgram in 2021. She also claimed that she was essentially raped by Manson while filming the music video for Heart-Shaped Glasses in 2007. She talked about it in her 2022 Sundance documentary Phoenix Rising - Part I:Don't Fall.</span></p><p><span>However, the singer's attorney denied her allegations and stated her imaginative retelling of the making of the Heart-Shaped Glasses music video 15 years ago was the most brazen and easiest to disprove as there were multiple witnesses. Morover, Manson's ex-wife, Dita Von Teese also supported him saying that there was no kind of abuse in their relationship and urged those accusers to heal and fully realize themselves.</span></p><p><span>Marilyn Manson made his relationship with Lindsay Usich public in 2012 Revolver profile and she has worked with him for his 2012 album's cover art Born Villain. The couple got married in a private ceremony during the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. And Manson shared about his wedding with Nicolas Cage and said that he was the only guest at his wedding on FaceTime and sang Love Me Tender.</span></p><p><span>Marilyn and his wife, Lindasy were spotted attending Kanye West's Sunday Service on Feb 2022 after his former fiancee, Rachel Wood and multiple other women accused him of sexual and psycholgical abuse. The couple wore all black concept outfit as Manson wore a balck leather jacket, baseball cap and combat boots while his wife, Usich wore her dark black hair in a bun and sat by his side putting her hands on his shoulder.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Marilyn Manson</span></strong></h2><p><span>Marilyn Manson has an estimated net worth of $5 million as an artist, actor, singer, film director and poet. However, his net worth was $25 million but series of incidents shone a spotlight on the dark side of Manson so his fortunes degraded to his current net worth.</span></p><p><span>Marilyn Manson started his career with his band, Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids in 1989 and their debut album, Portrait of an American Family became hit after it's release in 1994. Some of their EPs and albums are Smells Like Children, Antichrsit Superstar, Mechanical Animals, Holy Wood, The Golden Age of Grotesque, The High End of Low, Born Villain, The Pale Emperor, and more.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He made headlines for his controversial songs but he was also popular for them and his album, Antichrist Superstar went platinum in both the US and Canada.
