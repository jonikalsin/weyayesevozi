Anna Nicole Smith was a renowned American model who gained popularity when she won the Playmate title in 1993.</p><p>Her appearance on Playboy propelled the model to stardom, and she went on to model for fashion companies such as Guess, H&M, and other luxury fashion companies in her prime. However, before the glitz and glamour, the renowned model was born Vickie Lynn Hogan before she chose Anna Nicole Smith as her stage name.</p><p>The late actress and her ex-husband had a son together, but whatever became of them?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Billy_Wayne_Smith></span>Who Is Billy Wayne Smith<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Billy Wayne Smith was born to his parents in 1968 in the US. Although his exact birthplace is unknown, Billy is an American. Details about his early life and parents are undisclosed to the media to this day. Furthermore, there are reports that Billy’s family struggled financially. And as a result, he dropped out of high school and tried his hand at several jobs.</p><p>However, the renowned model’s ex-husband opted to settle as a fry cook at Jim’s Krispy Fried Chicken, a restaurant in Mexia, Texas. Where he met the woman who would later become his wife, and ultimately, ex-wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Billy_Wayne_Smith_and_Anna_Nicole_Smith_Meet></span>How Did Billy Wayne Smith and Anna Nicole Smith Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The pair met during their teenage years while working together at Jim’s Krispy Fried Chicken. The duo were regular teenagers trying to make a living at the time.</p><p>While Billy Wayne Smith worked as the restaurant’s fry cook, his ex-wife, Anna Nicole Smith, worked as a waitress. While anyone would have easily fallen for Anna Nicole Smith’s beauty, Billy barely paid her any attention although they worked together.</p><p>According to Billy Wayne Smith’s ex-wife, this was why she pursued him until they got married. She <a href=#>said</a>:</p><p>“He drove me crazy. I chased him and chased him the way young girls do until I finally got him and married him. By then, of course, I wasn’t interested”.</p>-Anna Nicole Smith<p>The pair got romantically involved in 1984 and took their relationship up a notch by getting married a year later in 1985. Notably, Anna Nicole Smith was a year older at the time of their marriage. The late actress was 17 while Billy was only 16. The couple had a small wedding ceremony with close friends and family in attendance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Long_Was_Billy_Wayne_Smith_And_Anna_Nicole_Smith_Married_For></span>How Long Was Billy Wayne Smith And Anna Nicole Smith Married For<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Billy Wayne Smith and Anna Nicole Smith welcomed their first and only child together, Daniel Wayne Smith, in 1986, a year after exchanging vows. Under normal circumstances, welcoming a child together further solidifies a marriage but unfortunately, that was not the case with Billy Wayne Smith and his ex-wife.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-8_14_36_13.jpg><p>Trouble started brewing in paradise barely after two years of marriage, which later saw the pair going their separate ways in 1987. The teenage couple reportedly had a hard time coping with parenting as they both had busy schedules and their jobs took most of their time.</p><p>However, Anna Nicole Smith later opened up about what it was like being in a marriage with Billy Wayne Smith, she said the marriage was a “disaster” and that Billy was overly protective. In addition to this, the late model and actress asserted that her ex-husband also neglected her in the marriage.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Did_Anna_Nicole_Smith_And_her_First_Husband_Divorce></span>When Did Anna Nicole Smith And her First Husband Divorce<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Billy Wayne Smith and his ex-wife remained separated for six years before they eventually finalized their divorce in 1993. The late model however allegedly started dating Howard Marshall, a billionaire businessman, while still legally married to Billy.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-8_14_37_23.jpg><p>A year after finalizing their divorce, Anna married her billionaire boyfriend, Howard Marshall. Her marriage to Howard Marshall propelled her to fame and she became famous for her modeling career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Billy_Wayne_Smith_And_Anna_Nicole_Smiths_Son></span>Who Is Billy Wayne Smith And Anna Nicole Smith’s Son<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After their separation, <a href=#>Anna Nicole Smith</a> moved to Houston with their son, Daniel Wayne Smith. However, having a son did not stop the late actress from dabbling into menial jobs to make a livelihood. Anna Nicole’s son was reportedly raised by her mom, Virgie Arthur. The late actress worked several jobs before she eventually switched to entertainment.</p><p>Unfortunately, Billy Wayne Smith and Anna Nicole Smith’s son, <a href=#>Daniel Wayne Smith</a>, died after overdosing on Methadone and anti-depressants in 2006. There were reports that Billy and Anna’s son struggled with depression before eventually losing the battle. Billy and his family held a&nbsp; memorial service for Daniel in Texas but buried him in the Bahamas. Anna was absent at her son’s memorial as she had just given birth to her daughter, <a href=#>Dannielynn Birkhead</a>, whose paternity case made rounds in the media.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/fotor_2023-5-8_14_41_1.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_Is_Anna_Nicole_Smiths_Ex-Husband_Now></span>Where Is Anna Nicole Smith’s Ex-Husband Now?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Billy Wayne Smith is alive and kicking, he is 55 years old. However, Anna Nicole Smith passed away in 2007 due to an overdose. Billy’s absence at her funeral raised questions about what transpired between the pair after their divorce.&nbsp; Some worried about his health while others acknowledged he and his ex-wife probably didn’t stay friends after their divorce in 1993.</p><p>Whatever the case, Billy will always be known as Anna Nicole Smith’s first husband.</p><p>Billy is keeping a low profile, he has not been in the media since his son’s memorial. There have been no hints regarding his whereabouts or whether he has started a new family. For all we know Billy might still be in the food business.</p><p>Although Billy Wayne Smith and the late model were together for barely two years, Actor <a href=#>John Travolta</a> and his wife were together for 28 years before their marriage was cut short by death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kr6q4y7JksJmpo7Juv8yiq6Flp52ys7GMoqpmoJViu7DDjg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbilly-wayne-smith-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbilly-wayne-smith-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbilly-wayne-smith-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbilly-wayne-smith-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbilly-wayne-smith-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbilly-wayne-smith-where-is-he-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meet-sarah-stretch-emerson-the-wife-of-joseph-emerson-their-married-life-kids.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meet-sarah-stretch-emerson-the-wife-of-joseph-emerson-their-married-life-kids.html>Meet Sarah Stretch Emerson, the Wife of Joseph Emerson: Their Married Life &amp;amp; Kids</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-was-russell-wilsons-first-wife.html>Who was Russell Wilson's First Wife?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-was-russell-wilsons-first-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
