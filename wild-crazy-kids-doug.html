<time>07 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Nickelodeon’s inaugural trio of animated original series—Doug, Ren & Stimpy, and Rugrats—made their debut on a shared date, August 11, 1991.</p><p>Ren & Stimpy, a surreal spectacle featuring a chihuahua and a cat, garnered a substantial fan following, with both characters being voiced by Billy West following the departure of the original Ren, John Kricfalusi, who was somewhat akin to Dan Harmon in the realm of children’s television at that time.</p><p>However, I personally wasn’t particularly fond of the animation style, and my mother was quite explicit about her reservations regarding its appropriateness for children.</p><p>Rugrats, a series centered around a group of articulate infants, achieved even greater popularity, boasting over 100 episodes and giving rise to both films and subsequent series.</p><p>Nonetheless, as I journeyed through my childhood, I found myself less inclined to follow the escapades of babies, although I did hold an affinity for Reptar (and if I’m being honest, Muppet Babies).</p><p>Out of the initial trio of animated shows, I gravitated towards Doug. Looking back, it’s not difficult to discern the reasons behind this preference.</p><p>While Ren & Stimpy and Rugrats each possessed their own unique merits, I couldn’t establish a deeper connection with them beyond sheer entertainment.</p><p>At the time, Nickelodeon was already forging a path to success with its live-action original programming lineup.</p><p>Prior to the debut of the three animated series, the network had already produced comedies like Hey Dude, Clarissa Explains It All, and Salute Your Shorts (with The Adventures of Pete & Pete soon to follow), alongside game shows such as Double Dare and the eponymous Wild & Crazy Kids.</p><p>However, those shows failed to resonate with me on a personal level. I either lacked the maturity to comprehend the world of early teenagers fully, found myself captivated by the whimsical narrative style of a series like Pete & Pete, or was simply caught up in the ever-changing mini-games presented on game shows.</p><p>When I first started watching Doug, I was roughly the same age as its protagonist, Doug Funnie. Growing up in the same town throughout my entire childhood, I couldn’t initially relate to the show’s beginning.</p><p>However, the themes of changing schools, forging new friendships, experiencing first crushes, discovering music, and journaling my daily life were all aspects that resonated with me.</p><p>Doug isn’t a universally relatable experience, much like Lena Dunham’s Girls, which represents a very specific facet of American culture.</p><p>But if you find yourself within its parameters, it offers a surprising depth.</p><p>No, this doesn’t mean that Doug operates at the same level of tightly controlled storytelling as Girls, but it addresses many of the criticisms directed at shows with a narrow cultural focus.</p><p>The series’ first episode, “Doug Bags a Neematoad,” introduces most of the key elements, despite not being the official pilot of the series (that distinction belongs to the first half of the second episode, “Doug Can’t Dance,” where Billy West is still finding his footing as the voice of Doug, and the animation is somewhat hasty).</p><p>The Funnie family relocates to Bluffington from a neighboring town, and Doug documents his nervousness about the move in his diary, even though his family seems content.</p><p>His father takes photographs, his mother organizes the move, and his sister Judy is an unconventional beatnik. Meanwhile, their new neighbors include the eccentric Bud Dink and the sardonically dry Tippy Dink.</p><p>Doug finds solace in the act of documenting his thoughts in a journal. He enjoys the process of cataloging, weaving tales, and indulging in imaginative daydreams that give rise to larger-than-life characters and scenarios.</p><p>This inclination starkly contrasts his predominantly reserved and introverted demeanor, especially in the company of most people, except for his close friend Mosquito, or “Skeeter” Valentine.</p><p>Over time, Skeeter evolves from the kid who assists Doug in navigating the perplexing menu at Honker Burger (a fast-food joint reminiscent of In-N-Out Burger with its uncomplicated yet somewhat secretive ordering system) into an unwaveringly loyal best friend, sharing numerous common interests with Doug.</p><p>Beyond mere shyness, Doug often grapples with episodes of intense social anxiety.</p><p>The fear of potentially appearing foolish or inadequate can paralyze him, prompting him to seek refuge in his rich inner world, where he transforms into a valiant figure capable of conquering his fears.</p><p>In these reveries, he can take on a schoolyard bully or tackle the seemingly mundane task of consuming liver and onions for dinner.</p><p>Whether he becomes a superhero wielding mind control as Quailman, a suave James Bond-style superspy like Smash Adams, or an Indiana Jones-inspired explorer as Race Canyon, Doug’s imagination knows no bounds.</p><p>He possesses artistic talents without necessarily dedicating his life to art, stumbles into moments of accidental athleticism through sheer luck, boasts a reasonable level of intelligence, and exudes extreme kindness and thoughtfulness.</p><p>He embodies the essence of “Everykid,” albeit within the constraints of representing a particular demographic: that of an 11-year-old Caucasian boy from a suburban setting, intended to resonate with as many individuals within that context as possible.</p><p>Bluffington, with its whimsical and fantastical portrayal of a suburban American town (albeit one with a broader spectrum of skin tones than reality permits), is said to draw inspiration from Richmond, Virginia.</p><p>However, as a Bay Area native, I find it challenging to spot any hidden details that might exist.</p><p>Also Read: <a href=# rel=noopener>Roundtable Review: Taxi, “Like Father, Like Daughter”</a></p><p>The town’s population comprises a colorful cast of memorable supporting characters, including the Dinks, Vice Principal Bone, and Chalky Studebaker, among others.</p><p>The series also delves into numerous episodes centered around Doug’s relationship with his parents and siblings, such as the one where his father assists him in crafting a kite, a vivid memory that stands out.</p><p>Yet, for me, the essence of Doug revolves around Doug Funnie’s friendships with three individuals: Skeeter Valentine, Patti Mayonnaise, and Roger Klotz.</p><p>Despite their similar interests, Doug and Skeeter share numerous friendship milestones throughout the series. They experience unique adventures, like meeting their musical idols multiple times, especially in the epic “Doug’s Hot Ticket.”</p><p>They even embark on the comical journey of forming an excessively large garage band in “Doug’s Garage Band,” complete with some entertaining original music.</p><p>Their strong bond is such that when Skeeter learns about his impending move at the end of the first season, both he and Doug are overwhelmed with the fear of never seeing each other again.</p><p>Real-world logic takes a backseat to the emotional turmoil of potentially losing a best friend. At the age of 11, dealing with suburban social problems, the prospect of losing a best friend becomes the most significant concern, eclipsing everything else.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thiswastv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/doug.jpg><p>Skeeter takes the initiative to arrange a friendly group outing that includes Patti and Beebe Bluff, allowing Doug the opportunity to sit with Patti on a Ferris wheel.</p><p>In many ways, Skeeter serves as a precursor to characters like Gerald on Hey Arnold, the unwavering best friend who occasionally steps into the limelight but primarily exists to offer support as the less neurotic counterpart to the series lead.</p><p>Doug’s infatuation with Patti never evolves beyond the realm of childlike fascination. His crush remains entirely innocent, as he is, after all, just an 11-year-old kid.</p><p>The simple act of holding Patti’s hand when they disembark from the Ferris wheel fills him with an incredible sense of exhilaration. Over time, he becomes more at ease in her presence.</p><p>At the outset of the series, he can barely talk to her without stammering like a bumbling fool, but gradually, communication becomes more natural.</p><p>Patti is somewhat of a tomboy, highly athletic, and has a father with a disability. Doug envisions Patti as a strong, independent young woman who fends off numerous admirers.</p><p>In one of his daydreams, he portrays himself as a medieval knight, approaching Princess Patti in a tower to invite her to the fair.</p><p>His crush consumes his thoughts, yet it remains almost inconsequential since, given his age, he lacks the capacity to take meaningful action.</p><p>It reflects the adolescent stage when girls become increasingly noticeable but haven’t yet become the central focus of young boys’ lives.</p><p>An advantage of animation is that Doug remains 11 years old throughout the entire duration of the show on Nickelodeon. The characters don’t age, so to a certain extent, their motivations remain constant.</p><p>It’s rather intriguing to note that Billy West lent his voice to both the lead character of the series and the primary antagonist, Roger Klotz, at least until West’s departure from the show due to a contract dispute when it became a Disney property.</p><p>Considering that one of the central story arcs in the series involves Roger and Doug gradually developing a deeper understanding of each other, the numerous dialogues that West had with himself take on added significance in retrospect, especially once the voice cast is known.</p><p>Doug and Roger engage in heated exchanges, endure moments of embarrassment at the hands of their respective grandmothers, and share common anxieties about the challenges of growing older and transitioning to a new school.</p><p>Take, for example, the early Season 2 episode titled “Doug Vs. The Klotzoid Zombies.” The episode kicks off with all of Doug’s friends heading over to Roger’s house without him.</p><p>This leaves Doug concerned that they’ve somehow fallen under Roger’s influence, leading to an extensive mission for Doug’s comic book alter ego, Quailman, pitted against the nefarious Dr. Klotzenstein.</p><p>The fantasy sequence brilliantly satirizes the villainy of 1960s-era Batman while also providing a not-so-subtle critique of greasy and unhealthy snack foods, which constitute a significant portion of the advertising revenue for a network targeting a young audience.</p><p>Doug’s tenure on Nickelodeon wasn’t extraordinarily lengthy, but it did enjoy a significant run that was quite typical for a moderately successful children’s show during that era.</p><p>When Disney acquired Jim Jinkins’s Jumbo Pictures, Doug transitioned to Disney’s Saturday morning lineup.</p><p>This move involved advancing the characters to junior high and updating the animation style. Surprisingly, this new iteration eventually amassed more episodes than the original run of the series.</p><p>While some fans viewed this shift as sacrilegious, it didn’t irreparably damage the quiet legacy of Doug’s initial four seasons and 52 episodes on Nickelodeon.</p><p>These episodes continue to air endlessly well into the new millennium, keeping the show alive for new generations of viewers.</p><p>I don’t believe it’s a matter of whether Doug remains relevant after more than two decades.</p><p>While some of the jokes still hit the mark, the animation shows signs of its age, with certain elements appearing a bit crude, and the storytelling often comes across as clunky and lacking in depth.</p><p>However, during my childhood, I gleaned valuable and straightforward life lessons from Doug.</p><p>I paid close attention because I could identify with the character of the shy, awkward kid who meticulously recorded his thoughts in his journal.</p><p>Nickelodeon managed to achieve a triumphant trifecta with its initial animated productions, setting the stage for a remarkable run that would give rise to some of the defining cartoons of the decade.</p><p>This streak solidified the network’s status as one of the most influential players in the realm of cable television since its inception.</p><p><strong>Odds & ends:</strong></p><ul><li>Welcome to Wild & Crazy Kids! Here I’ll discuss kids’ shows from the rise of cable networks like Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network.</li><li>Most episodes of&nbsp;Doug&nbsp;can be found by those willing to do a little digging. Going by the&nbsp;Wikipedia inventory of episodes, I referred to about ten different segments.</li><li>The&nbsp;Doug&nbsp;nostalgia is still heavy enough that a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>parody trailer</a>&nbsp;of Doug returning from college has nearly two million views.</li><li>A popular Buzzfeed article made the rounds a while ago about&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>how many different touchstone characters Billy West has voiced</a>&nbsp;over the years, but what really sticks out to me about his career is how embittered he seems to be about everything. He notoriously hates celebrities doing voice work instead of proven voiceover actors, and he was incredibly critical of&nbsp;Disney’s Doug&nbsp;and his replacement Tom McHugh.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJ7AuK3Sra1nm5%2BifLi1y51knKqRr8Zut8idqmacn6q0cA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwild-crazy-kids-doug.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwild-crazy-kids-doug.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwild-crazy-kids-doug.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwild-crazy-kids-doug.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwild-crazy-kids-doug.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwild-crazy-kids-doug.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./baby-tate-hitmaka-diss-song-pussy-rapper.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./baby-tate-hitmaka-diss-song-pussy-rapper.html>Baby Tate Drops Hitmaka Diss Song After Female Rapper Comments</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./i-wasnt-pretty-enough-original-boy-meets-world-star-explains-why-she-was-fired-from-disney-show.html>Shannen Doherty Addresses Why She Was Fired From Beverly Hills, 90210: I Dont Blame Anyo</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./i-wasnt-pretty-enough-original-boy-meets-world-star-explains-why-she-was-fired-from-disney-show.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
