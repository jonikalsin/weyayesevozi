Who is Jens Pulver dating now & how much money does Jens Pulver have?</p><h2>Jens Pulver Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Jens Pulver</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>MMA Fighter</strong> who was born on <strong>December 6, 1974</strong> in Sunnyside, Washington State, <strong>United States</strong>. Mixed martial arts fighter who became the first Lightweight Champion in the Ultimate Fighting Championship league.</p><p>He developed a rivalry with <a href=#>Dennis Hallman</a>, who he first defended his UFC Lightweight Championship against in September, 2001.</p><p>Pulver began competing in the UFC in September 1999. He fought four times in the UFC before gaining a title shot against top ranked Japanese Fighter Caol Uno in February 2001. Pulver won the title by unanimous decision, becoming the first UFC Lightweight Champion. He defended his title twice (against Dennis Hallman and B.J. Penn) before leaving the organization due to contractual problems. Pulver became famous for his combination of defensive wrestling and boxing strategies colloquially called “sprawl and brawl” in MMA circles.</p><p>Pulver moved to Lockeford, California in 1999 where he briefly trained at the Lion’s Den and then joined Shamrock 2000, a short lived camp formed by Bob Shamrock (the foster father of Ken and Frank Shamrock) Kevin Woo, and Dr. Ron Emmerson. Pulver noted that there was a little kid who would show up at the gym to hit the bags in those days named Nick Diaz with his younger brother Nate, both of whom later became MMA stars. Pulver, who hated his name because it was the same as his father’s, even asked Bob at one point if he could take the Shamrock name since Bob was the first real father figure he felt he ever had. Bob told him: “You go out there and make the Pulver name mean something good.” (Pulver would later go on to become the first 155-pound champion in UFC history.) Pulver wanted to fight full-time, but they did not have the right training partners for him. Shamrock put him in contact with Monte Cox and sent him to Iowa, where Pat Miletich was starting a camp where he could train full-time.</p><p align=justify>He married Kannika Pulver on July 4, 2009. He has two children named Karson Jens and Madeline Pulver.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jens Pulver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jens</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pulver</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>MMA Fighter</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 6</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1974</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sunnyside</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Kannika Pulver</strong></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Madeline Pulver, Karson Jens Pulver</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jens Pulver ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

He found early success fighting in unsanctioned “underground” events, before befriending Lowell Anderson, the owner of a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) academy ninety miles north of Boise, Idaho. Lowell got Pulver involved in sanctioned MMA events, namely the Bas Rutten Invitational in April 1999. Pulver won one match, then lost the second due to his lack of martial arts training. He fought again in the third incarnation of the Bas Rutten Invitational, winning both his fights and impressing then-UFC matchmaker, John Perretti.</p><p align=justify>Pulver and Faber finally met at WEC 34 on June 1, 2008. Neither man was able to finish the other and the fight went the full five rounds. The judges scored the bout a unanimous decision for Faber, 50–45, 50–44 and 50–44. This fight marked the first time that one of Pulver’s fights at featherweight had gone to decision, the first time Pulver had been defeated at that weight class and also the first time one of Faber’s fights in the WEC had gone the distance. Pulver stated after the fight that he wanted another shot at the title, but wanted “to earn it”.</p><h2>Who is Jens Pulver Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Jens Pulver</strong> married to <strong>Kannika Pulver </strong>.
