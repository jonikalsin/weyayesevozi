On this channel, we tour some of the most incredible properties in the country and around the world.”</p><p>He lived in Texas until 2018, when he sold his home and moved to LA full-time.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Deshae Frost Net Worth</a></p><h2><b>Enes Yilmazer – Net Worth</b></h2><p><br>So, how much is Enes Yilmazer worth?</p><p>As a real estate enthusiast and YouTuber, Enes Yilmazer has accumulated the majority of his net worth from his online endeavors and by flipping properties.</p><p>He has enjoyed great success on his YouTube channel for the unique nature of his content, which sees him secure access to the most incredible real estate on the planet.</p><p>Alongside his cameraman Mikey, Enes enters the homes and broadcasts a tour from within and around the grounds, which gives people insight into what it’s like to live in some of the most stunning properties ever built.</p><h4><strong>YouTube</strong></h4><p>His channel has more than 3.24 million subscribers, and his videos have been watched in excess of 567 million times.<span style=font-weight:400> This has seen him net about $1.7 million in ad revenue from YouTube, which has contributed significantly to his net worth as a result. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Mansion Global</a>, Enes makes between $50,000 and $100,000 per month from YouTube.</span></p><p>Enes assists Realtors by showcasing their properties on his channel, which broadens their appeal and benefit from his stunning videography.</p><p>While we can’t say for sure, it’s likely that Ends negotiates a deal with the Realtors and receives a commission for broadcasting the properties that feature on his channel.</p><p>Whether it’s a flat fee or a fee based on the sale of the property, his channel undoubtedly helps Realtors move some of the most expensive properties in the world, so it’s very likely that Enes benefits financially from the situation.</p><p>Another potential source of income for Enes is YouTube Red, which is financed by viewers who pay a monthly view to watch content on the platform.</p><p>Again, while it’s not clear precisely how much he makes from subscribers, it’s clear that this has been another factor in building his impressive net worth.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Real Estate</strong></h4><p>Although he is now a successful YouTuber, Enes made a name for himself as a Realtor in Los Angeles.</p><p>When he realized that he could monetize his YouTube channel and found a niche in the market, he decided to quit his job as an agent and focus on content creation full-time.</p><p>He purchased his first home in Corpus Christie, Texas, when he was just 21, and he has been investing in real estate ever since.</p><p>Yilmazer used his location in Corpus Christie to invest in empty lots that he would then flip for a profit, which is how he managed to get a foothold in American real estate from such a young age.</p><p>He admits to making a lot of money from flipping properties in Texas, which is what motivated him to move to LA and pursue a career in real estate, inspired by the gains that he had already made.</p><p>Talking about why he was motivated to branch out onto YouTube full time, Enes <a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>said</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>:</span></p><p>“I’ve had a lot of cool things happen to me in my life, and I always wished I had an opportunity to share that with the world. And that’s why I started a YouTube channel.”</p><p>Therefore, Enes Yilmazer has an estimated net worth of $3 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is CaptainSparklez</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfmrumv4yyoKWlka%2Bys3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fenes-yilmazer-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fenes-yilmazer-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fenes-yilmazer-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fenes-yilmazer-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fenes-yilmazer-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fenes-yilmazer-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-sanzone-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-sanzone-biography.html>Michael Sanzone Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./adrian-healey.html>Adrian Healey - Bio, Married, Nationality, Height, Net Worth, Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./adrian-healey.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
