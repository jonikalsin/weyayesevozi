An actor from Pakistan and England who gained notoriety for his frequent appearances on Upstairs Downstairs, Borgia, and Holby City.&nbsp;His unforgettable role in the role of Hari Kumar in The Jewel in the Crown added to his popularity early on in his career.</p><p>He played&nbsp;Anthony Hopkins&nbsp;in the adaptation in the film The Wolfman.</p><p>Malik was born Athar ul-Haque Malik in Bahawalpur, Pakistan, the son of Zaibunisa and Mazhar ul-Haque Malik, a doctor who would soon qualify as an ophthalmic surgeon in Britain. When his father secured a job as a surgeon in Moorfields Eye Hospital, Malik was brought to London in 1956, aged three, with his four older brothers. At age 10 he was sent to school in Quetta, Balochistan, for one year, and then Bec Grammar School, a selective state school in Upper Tooting, London.</p><p>In 1982, five years after leaving Guildhall, Malik was cast as Hari Kumar in the Granada Television production of The Jewel in the Crown, based on Paul Scott’s Raj Quartet. Born in India but educated at the elite English public school Chillingborough, where he was called ‘Harry,’ Hari is out-of-place in both countries — too Indian for England and too English for India. During filming of the series, David Lean cast him in his production of A Passage to India, the two popular and much-praised productions assuring his professional future. He also appeared in a television serialisation of M.M. Kaye’s The Far Pavilions. All three were released in 1984.</p><p align=justify>There were two girls together with his wife of more than 30 years.
