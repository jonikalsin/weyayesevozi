Calvin Murphy’s jersey with #23 is retired and in 1993 he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. With his 5’9″ (175cm) height, Murphy is the shortest basketball hall of famer ever. Currently, he serves as ESPN’s “The Calvin Murphy Show” host, as well as a Houston Rockets’ Root Sports TV broadcast team member.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this Rockets’ legend has accumulated so far? How rich Calvin Murphy is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total amount of Calvin Murphy’s net worth, as of late 2016, is $3 million. It has been primarily acquired during his 13-years long professional basketball career, and broadcasting too.</p><h3>Calvin Murphy Net Worth $3 million</h3><p>Prior to discovering himself in basketball, Calvin Murphy was a world-class baton twirler – in 1963 he was a national competition winner. He attended Norwalk High School where he started playing basketball, being named to Team All-America twice and Team All-State three times during his high school career. In 1967, Calvin enrolled at Niagara University in Niagara County, New York, where he continued his basketball career. With an average of 33.1 points per game, it is no wonder that he was selected for the All-America team three times in a row, between 1967 and 1970.</p><p>In the 1970 NBA Draft, Calvin Murphy was selected as the pick No.1 in the second round (18th overall) by San Diego Rockets. Good shooting, quickness as well as high defensive awareness earned him a place in the 1971 NBA All-Rookie First Team. It is certain that this accomplishment stamped a path to a bright professional basketball career, and also provided the basis for Calvin Murphy’s net worth.</p><p>In 1971, the team relocated to Houston, and consequently changed its name to the Houston Rockets. The real breakthrough in Calvin Murphy’s professional career occurred in the season 1977/1978 during which he averaged 25.6 points per game. He set several league and Rocket’s internal records, such as consecutive free throws record (78) and team’s most assists record (4,402) of which the latter hasn’t been broken yet. In 1979, Calvin was chosen for the All-Star team. Doubtlessly, all these achievements helped Calvin Murphy to increase the total size of his wealth by a significant sum of money.</p><p>During his 13-years long professional basketball career in the Rockets, Calvin Murphy scored a total of 17,949 points, making him the team’s second highest scorer ever behind <a href=#>Hakeem Olajuwon</a> with 26,946 points. Upon his retirement from professional basketball in 1983, the Rockets retired his #23 jersey making Calvin Murphy one of only three players with that honor.</p><p>After retirement, Murphy remained active within the Rockets’ organization – as a television analyst and broadcast crew member of Houston Rockets’ Root Sports TV. All these accomplishments have contributed to the total size of Calvin Murphy’s net worth.</p><p>When it comes to personal life, Calvin Murphy’s is pretty unusual, as he has 14 children with nine women, one of whom he married, but apparently was secretive about his relationships, until in 2004 he was accused of the sexual abuse of five of his daughters; however, after an eight-month long trial, the court found him not guilty.</p><p>In 1978 he was honored with the J. Walter Kennedy Humanitarian Award.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=7.8447136563877><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Calvin Murphy</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>May 9, 1948</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Norwalk, Connecticut, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.75 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>72 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Norwalk High School, Niagara University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Spouse</td><td>Phyllis Davidson, Vernetta Murphy</td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1736992/</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Awards</td><td>NBA All-Rookie Team, National Basketball Association Awards - J.
