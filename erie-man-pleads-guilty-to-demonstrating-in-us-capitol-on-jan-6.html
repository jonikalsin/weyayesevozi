On Jan. 5, according to the <a class=Link href=# rel=noopener>statement of offense</a> Grover agreed to sign as part of his plea agreement, he posted several messages to Facebook about is expectations for the next day.</p><p>“If you accept the reality that the election was stolen, than [sic] you cannot accept Biden as the new president – & neither can I… which is why I flew to DC yesterday,” he wrote in one post. “I fought for this nation. Brothers & Sisters lost limbs & life for this nation. I won’t sit idle while the nation is stolen in some insane, slow motion, treasonous insurrection.”</p><p>In another post that day, he wrote: “I have no interest in violence. Sadly, I recognize that violence is highly likely. I’m not certain what’s going to happen tomorrow. I am certain I need to be here.”</p><p><a class=Link href=# rel=noopener>The Denver Post reported</a> Grover served in the Army Reserve for almost 10 years, from 2001 to 2011, and deployed to Iraq in 2004.</p><p>Also on Jan. 5, Grover took a photo of himself in front of one of the signs on Capitol grounds that said the area was closed. He went to Trump’s rally the next day, then back to his hotel, before he went over to the area in front of the Capitol that had been breached by others around 2:45 p.m. on Jan. 6.</p><p>While outside the Capitol, he took pictures of himself and others, and around 3:15 p.m., he entered the Capitol Rotunda east door, where police officers were trying to keep people from coming inside. He and others were able to push past the officers, <a class=Link href=# rel=noopener>according to the court documents.</a></p><p>He was in the Rotunda with others until about 3:21 p.m., when officers forced them away, and left the Capitol building just after 3:30 p.m., though he would remain in the restricted Capitol grounds until shortly after 5 p.m., according to the document.</p><p>Grover is one of 15 Coloradans charged in connections with the Jan. 6 riot, and several others either traveled there from Colorado or were arrested in Colorado to face federal charges:</p><ul><li><b>Jacob Clark</b>&nbsp;of Trinidad&nbsp;<a class=Link href=#>was arrested</a>&nbsp;in April 2021 on multiple charges in connection to the Jan. 6 riot.
