Upon retiring from the field, he continued his broadcasting career, which he had started before his playing days were over.</p><p>To talk about Gary‚Äôs personal life, he is happily married to <strong>Kristy Danielson</strong>. The couple has been together for many years, and people might be wondering how their love story began. So, in today‚Äôs article, let‚Äôs learn about Gary Danielson‚Äôs wife and more about their marital life.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Met_At_College></span>Met At College<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, the American college football commentator shares a blissful marital life with Kristy Danielson. The couple met while attending Purdue University.</p><p>Gary Danielson‚Äôs wife, Kristy, is the daughter of <strong>George King</strong>, who was the head basketball coach and athletic director of Purdue then. The pair might have hit off instantly and begun their relationship. Soon after, the lovebirds tied the knot in 1973.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gary-Danielson-got-married.jpg><p>However, Gary and his beloved spouse have refrained from sharing any details of their wedding. But it must have been a lovely ceremony. All in all, Mr. and Mrs. Danielson must be enjoying their marital bliss. May their love for one another and bond remain intact for a lifetime.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Gary_Danielsons_Wife_Is_A_Proud_Mother></span>Gary Danielson‚Äôs Wife Is A Proud Mother<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It has been many years since the former player and Kristy tied the knot. The couple withstood several ups and downs in the marital bliss of several decades. Unfortunately, one of the tragic incidents they had to face was the demise of their infant baby girl. In 1980, Gary Danielson‚Äôs daughter, <strong>Kaity Danielson,</strong> died of a heart ailment just 9 days after her birth.</p><p>It must have been a tough moment for the duo, but they never gave up. Three days later, Kristy Danielson‚Äôs husband went to play against the Packers and led his team to victory. Furthermore, it was the best game of his career.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>ü¶Å OTD in 1980: Lions‚Äô QB Gary Danielson led DET to a 29-7 win over the Packers. Just 3 days earlier, Gary & wife Kristie‚Äôs 9 day old daughter Kaity died of a heart ailment. Gary completed 11/17 for 246 yds & 1 TD, carrying the Lions to a 2-0 start. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#OnePride</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/tvbwWUotok</a></p><p>‚Äî 80s Football Cards (@80sFootballCard) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">September 15, 2019</a></p><p>In addition, the couple also has <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>four kids</a>, who have remained away from the limelight over the years. Kristy and Gary Danielson‚Äôs children are <strong>Kelly Danielson, Matt David Danielson</strong>, <strong>Tracy Massey, </strong>and <strong>Molly Danielson Bronson</strong>. Among them, Matt has followed in their dad‚Äôs footsteps. He played football at Northwestern University in the early-2000s.</p><p>All in all, Gary Danielson and Kristy Danielson‚Äôs children must be doing well. Let‚Äôs hope we learn more about them in the coming days.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Know About Tara Lipinski‚Äôs Husband Todd Kapostasy</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Comes_From_A_Sports_Family></span>Comes From A Sports Family<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>A coaching job requires a person to remain away from their family for a long period. They have to be on the roads most of the time, and the only lucky ones are those who get to coach one team for a long time, as they don‚Äôt have to move on here and there. For any coach‚Äôs spouse, it might take a lot of patience to deal with everything when their partner is away.</p><p>In the same way, Gary Danielson‚Äôs wife has been with him from the beginning. From his playing journey to his broadcasting career, Kristy has supported him at every step. Coming from a sports background, she might have understood how everything works.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Kristy is the daughter of a basketball coach. She was born <strong>Kristy Jeanne King</strong> as one of the five children of <strong>Jeanne Greider King</strong> and <strong>George S. King Jr.</strong> She grew up in Naples, Florida, with her siblings, <strong>George S. King III, Kerry Rzeznik, Gordon Scott King</strong>, and <strong>Kathy Hirsty</strong>.</p><p>As already mentioned, just like her hubby, <strong>Kristy Jeanne King-Danielson</strong> went to Purdue University. Unfortunately, Kristy Danielson‚Äôs parents have already passed away. After a brief illness, her <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">dad died</a> on October 5, 2006. Likewise, her mom left the world on September 8, 2013.</p><p>Sadly, on January 23, 2016, Kristy lost her sister, <strong>Kathy Jan King-Hirsty</strong>. Furthermore, her brother, Gordon, posted on Facebook accusing her then-partner, <strong>Chris Grey,</strong> of murdering her. In addition, as per the post, the King siblings do not have good relationships with one another. Well, the exact truth remains hidden, but we hope we learn about it soon.</p><p>The loss of her father, sister, and mother must have devasted Kristy Danielson. Losing someone close to her must have been a really challenging time. Yet, despite all the unfortunate events, Gary‚Äôs spouse has remained strong. We hope she continues living the best life. Hopefully, we will get to learn more about her in the coming days. We wish her luck and light.</p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>For More Updates On&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Celebrity Babies</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Feuds</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Their Riches</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>,&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Siblings</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, And&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Entertainment</span></strong></a><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, Keep In Touch With&nbsp;</span></strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>eCelebrityMirror.</span></strong></a></p><strong>For More Updates on <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Articles</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Babies</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Feuds</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Siblings</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Entertainment</a>, <a href=# rel=dofollow data-wpel-link=internal>Richest Celebrities</a>, Keep In Touch With <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>eCelebritymirror.</a></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLPAq7BmnJGjtqa40qilZq%2BZm7Jut9Giqq2xXZmur7XEpaqopl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgary-danielson-wife-kristy-danielson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fgary-danielson-wife-kristy-danielson.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fgary-danielson-wife-kristy-danielson.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fgary-danielson-wife-kristy-danielson.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgary-danielson-wife-kristy-danielson.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgary-danielson-wife-kristy-danielson.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-get-jordans-for-retail-in-3-simple-steps.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-get-jordans-for-retail-in-3-simple-steps.html>How to get Jordans for Retail in 3 Simple Steps</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dakota-fanning-family-parents-siblings.html>The famous Dakota Fanning and her cute family: parents, siblings</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dakota-fanning-family-parents-siblings.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
